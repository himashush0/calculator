# calculator
This C++ program is a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator from the user. It uses a **switch statement** to perform the correct calculation and includes an **error check for division by zero**. It's an excellent example for beginners to understand fundamental concepts like user input, variables, and conditional logic.
This C++ program is a basic calculator that performs four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a great example for anyone new to programming. ðŸ’»

How It Works:
It prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.

The program reads these inputs and stores them in variables.

A switch statement checks which operator the user entered (+, -, *, or /).

Based on the operator, it performs the corresponding calculation.

It includes a specific check for division by zero to prevent an error, displaying a friendly message instead.

Finally, it prints the result of the calculation.

This code effectively demonstrates how to use variables, user input, and conditional logic (if and switch statements) to build a simple, functional program.
