# calculator
This C++ program is a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator from the user. It uses a **switch statement** to perform the correct calculation and includes an **error check for division by zero**. It's an excellent example for beginners to understand fundamental concepts like user input, variables, and conditional logic.
